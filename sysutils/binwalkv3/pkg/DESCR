This is an updated version of the Binwalk firmware analysis tool, re-written in
Rust for speed and accuracy.

Binwalk can identify, and optionally extract, files and data that have been
embedded inside of other files.

While its primary focus is firmware analysis, it supports a wide variety of file
and data types. Through entropy analysis, it can even help to identify unknown
compression or encryption. Binwalk can be customized and integrated into your
own Rust projects.
