Up to some tweaks to help users to get started, this should be
basically ready to import.

MAKE_ENV=LIBGIT2_NO_VENDOR=1 is due to hitting the following panic:

Caused by:
  process didn't exit successfully: `/usr/ports/pobj/jj-0.22.0/build-amd64/target/release/build/libgit2-sys-cf1afb13dc3326bc/build-script-build` (exit status: 101)
  --- stdout
  cargo:rerun-if-env-changed=LIBGIT2_NO_VENDOR
  cargo:rustc-cfg=libgit2_vendored

See the main Cargo.toml as well as:
https://github.com/rust-lang/git2-rs/commit/59a81cac9
https://github.com/rust-lang/git2-rs/commit/3cef4119f

Maybe this should be handled in cargo.port.mk instead.
